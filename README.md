# Location-Address Flow

This repository contains a project focused on implementing a location and address system. The project is split into two main parts: **Frontend** and **Backend**. 

## Project Overview

### Backend
The backend part of the project handles all server-side logic, database operations, and APIs for managing location and address-related functionalities. It processes requests, interacts with the database, and sends back responses.

### Frontend
The frontend of the project provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the system. It fetches data from the backend and presents it in a user-friendly manner. The frontend is designed to be responsive and accessible.

## Technologies Used

### Backend
- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript environment.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js to create APIs.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used for storing addresses and locations.

### Frontend
- **React**: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **HTML/CSS**: Standard technologies for structuring and styling web pages.
- **JavaScript**: Programming language used for frontend functionality.
  
## Installation and Setup

Follow the instructions below to set up the project locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/location-address-flow.git
cd location-address-flow
```

### 2. Backend Setup

#### Install Dependencies

Navigate to the `backend` folder and install required dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

#### Running the Backend

To start the backend server:

```bash
npm start
```

The backend should now be running on `http://localhost:5000`.

### 3. Frontend Setup

#### Install Dependencies

Navigate to the `frontend` folder and install required dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

#### Running the Frontend

To start the frontend development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The frontend should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### 4. Database Setup (if applicable)

If the project requires a database (e.g., MongoDB), make sure to set up the database and configure the necessary environment variables.

## Usage

- **Frontend**: The user interacts with a form that allows them to input location data (address, city, state, country, etc.). The frontend fetches the data from the backend and displays it.
  
- **Backend**: The backend provides API endpoints for adding, retrieving, and managing addresses.

### API Endpoints (Backend)
1. **POST /api/addresses**: Add a new address.
2. **GET /api/addresses**: Fetch all addresses.
3. **GET /api/addresses/:id**: Fetch a single address by ID.
4. **PUT /api/addresses/:id**: Update an existing address.
5. **DELETE /api/addresses/:id**: Delete an address.
